# Connect with your local church

The Body is an upcoming service to help connect the needs of existing church communities. We envision The Body as a text-based messaging platform and web application for Christians to find opportunities to serve their fellow believers, as well as a place for those in need to ask for help. The Body focuses on existing local church communities and uses invite codes to help connect individuals to local church hubs.
